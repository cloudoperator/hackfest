    So I have fixed up the graph to do a few things 
    First it now flickes through diffrent types and displayes there comparsomes that way.

    Second it can have its color changed. Will put a comment on where to change this

    Data is index in a piticuler way.
    "Beer" : "Spaights", "Price" : 7.50, "Per%" : 0.5
    
    "Beer" is the label for a type it is used to change diffeering display types.

     "Price"  is related to the axis that is is pertrayed on if you change this need to change the axis label aswell.

     "Per%" is also related to a axis same as above.

    */
    data = [
        { "Beer" : "Spaights", "Price" : 7.50, "Per%" : 0.5},

        { "Beer" : "Light", "Price" : 5, "Per%" : 0.25},

    chart = new dimple.chart(svg, data);

    // this is used to set the overall size of the chart.
    chart.setBounds(60, 30, 510, 305);

    chart.defaultColors = [
        new dimple.color("#FFFF00"),
        new dimple.color("#FFFF00")
    ];

    // This make a gradiale change based on the color inside i think.
    chart.addColorAxis("Per%", "#FF9933");

    // this made that effet of flipping thought the diffrent bar views.
    chart.setStoryboard("Beer");
    
    // these can be changed but need to change the data if you do.
    x = chart.addCategoryAxis("x", "Per%");
    y = chart.addMeasureAxis("y", "Price");
    
    // changeing this changes the type of grath. bar, line, bubble and area 
    s = chart.addSeries(null, dimple.plot.bar);


    x.addOrderRule(function (a, b) {
    // The example here uses the length of the strings to order the values in descending order.
